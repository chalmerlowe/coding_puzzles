# DESCRIPTION:

# In this puzzle, you will be given a file (1138090f.txt) that contains
#     a series of words, one word per line.
#
# Sort the words, by length. Ensure that you use a Stable Sorting algorithm.
# Once you have sorted the words by length, find all the words at the
#     following indexs:
#     * 22615
#     * 10582
#     * 353
#     * 1660
#     * 43880
#
# and display them on a single line, separated by spaces.

# For example... if the words in the file were:
#
# cat
# we
# python
# orangutan
# love

# And if you were given the indexes: 1, 4, 2, then
#     the answer would be:
#
#     we love python
